Postman testing

Use https://www.postman.com/lchavaje/workspace/wizeline-academy/overview to access the Postman collection of tests. It includes a bonus request to create three tasks using the DDT.csv file from this repository. 
To enclose the tasks in a project, run first "Create a new project". If the project is not created before, the tasks will be placed in the Inbox.

Automation testing

Use the collection and environment files to run. Check package.json to modify folders to run tests and generate a report.

Reports

Enclosed is an example report from a previous run.
